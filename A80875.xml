         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>ARTICLES of Peace, Friendship, and Entercourse, concluded and agreed between ENGLAND and FRANCE.</head>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is agreed and concluded, That from henceforth there shall be a Firm Peace, Amity, Alliance and Confederation between the Common-wealth of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and all the Lands, Dominions, Cities, and Places belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, or under their respective obedience. And the People and Subjects of each Nation may safely and freely travel in and through all the Ports, Havens, and Cities of either, as they shall think good, without any wrong or injustice to be done unto them; but rather all favour and justice, which the Judges and Officers of those places shall see duely observed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Neither part shall directly or indirectly, aid or assist the already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Rebels or Enemies of either, or their future Adherents. And if either part shall hereafter make Peace or Truce with their Enemies already so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the said Part, so making Peace or Truce, shall not give or yeeld any aid or assistance to the said Enemies or their Adherents, against the other.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That from henceforth all Acts of Hostility shall cease on both sides, as well upon the Sea, as at Land, Rivers, and Fresh-waters. And that all Letters of Marque or Reprizal, which have been granted by either Part against the other, either to their own People and Subjects, or to any others, shall be recalled and made void. And what shall be taken, upon any pretence after Fourteen dayes next immediatly ensuing the Publication of the present Treaty, shall well and truly be restored. And if any wrong or injury be done by either Part, or by the People, Subjects, or Inhabitants thereof, against the People, Subjects or Inhabitants of the other, either against the Articles of this Treaty, or against Common Right, there shall yet no Letters of Marque or Reprizal be granted by the one, or the other, till Justice be first sought in the ordinary course of Law; and in case that Justice be either refused or delayed, then, that demand be made thereof by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power of that Commonwealth, whose People or Inhabitants have suffered the wrong, or by such as the supream Power shall Depute. But if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172839:3"/> within Three months after such demand made, Satisfaction be not given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Justice, that then the said Letters of Marque or Reprizal may be granted, which yet shall not be put in execution against any Goods, Ships, or Persons in Port or Harbour, excepting such only as have committed the offence.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That between the said Commonwealth, and <hi>France,</hi> their respe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctive People and Subjects, as well by Land as by Sea and Fresh-waters, in all and singular their Countries, Dominions, Territories, Provinces, Cities, Towns, Villages, and all other Places in <hi>Europe,</hi> where Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce hath hitherto been, there shall be free Trade and Commerce, in such sort and manner as that without any safe Conduct or Licence general, or special, the People of the said Commonwealth, and Subjects of His said Majesty, may freely, as well by Land as Sea and Fresh-waters, go, enter, and sail into the said Countries, Kingdoms and Dominions, and all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Havens, Shores, Sea-roads, Straits, Ports and Places thereof, and put themselves into whatever Havens of the same, with Carriages, Horses, Burdens, Ships laden, and unladen, to bring in Merchandises, and there to buy and sell as much as they will; And in the same places, upon just prices, to procure provision of Victuals for their sustenance and Voyages; and likewise, as occasion shall require, to repair their Shipping and Carriages. And from thence also with their Merchandises, Goods and other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities whatsoever, they may with like freedom depart and go to their own Countreys, or any other Places at their pleasure, without let or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; They, and either of them on each side, paying the Customs and Toll due and accustomed, and observing and conforming in such their Trade and Traffique, to the Laws and Ordinances of each place respectively.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It is also agreed and concluded, That the People and Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions thereto belonging, may import and sell in any of the Ports, Cities, and Towns of the Dominions of <hi>France,</hi> all the Manufacture of Wool and Silk of the said Commonwealth, without Confiscation or penalty, Any Law, Arrest, Statute, Ordinance, or other thing to the contrary thereof notwithstanding. Provided, that the manner agreed and determined in the Thirteenth Article of the Treaty, between <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarr,</hi> in the year 1606. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cloth ill-wrought, be still held and observed. And that the Subjects of His said Majestie may freely import and sell in any the Havens, Cities and Towns of the said Commonwealth, all sorts of Wines of the growth of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172839:3"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and all Manufactures of Wool and Silk, made, or to be made in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> or the Dominions thereof, without confiscation or penalty to be sustained for the same; any Law, Statute, Ordinance, or other thing to the contrary notwithstanding. And that the People of this Commonwealth, and Subjects of his said Majesty, be kindly treated, and enjoy each with other the same Priviledges, which other Foreigners enjoy.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. To the end the Customs, Tolls and Impositions may on both sides be certain and known, and also that it may appear what is to be paid of right by such as shall exercise Merchandise in either Commonwealth or Kingdom, there shall be Tables made of the Customs, Tolls and Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and be set up in publick Places, as well in <hi>London</hi> and other Cities in the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> as at <hi>Roan</hi> and other Cities in <hi>France,</hi> where need shall be, whereunto recourse may be had when any doubt or question of the said Customs, Tolls, and Impositions shall arise.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Whereas several Taxes, Impositions, Liberties and Priviledges are pretended and challenged by some Cities and Places to be due unto them and their Inhabitants, in the Dominions of both the said Confederates; It is agreed, That the Magistrates and Officers of each City shall take care, that no greater Taxes and Impositions be taken, or Liberties or Priviledges used, then are allowed by the Law.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And whereas a certain Custome, not warranted by any Law, hath been introduced in some Ports of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France, viz.</hi> That every one, for his coming in, and going out, should pay a kind of tribute, called in French, <hi>Du chef,</hi> and in English, <hi>Head-money;</hi> It is agreed, That from henceforth it be no more demanded; that so ingress and egress may be free to all, of what quality and condition soever, without exaction of any duty in respect thereof; that so, as well in this case as in others, strangers be treated in like manner with the Natives.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. It is also agreed, That the French Merchants trafficking in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> shall not be constrained to put in any other Security for the sale of their Merchandise and uttering the proceed thereof in other Commodities, then their Juratory Caution, or to procure any Prolongation or Discharge, or be lyable to any greater expences in that regard, then the Inhabitants of the Country.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That the French Ships may freely arrive at the Key of <hi>London,</hi> and other the Ports and Places of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions thereof, and there be laden without any molestation; and without being compelled to unlade into other Vessels. And that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172839:4"/> Ships may with the same Liberty, and without any let or impediment enter any the Ports of <hi>France,</hi> and also use and enjoy the same privileges and immunities there, and that in all other things, as much as may be, an equality and liberty of Commerce be held and observed.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That the Merchants Ships of this Commonwealth, and the People and Inhabitants thereof, which shall go up to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> or enter into the River of <hi>Garonne,</hi> shall not be compelled in their passage, by the Castle of <hi>Blay,</hi> to take out their Ordnance, Arms or Ammunition. So also the People and Inhabitants of the said King, shal not be compelled to under-go any such impediment in any the Ports of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which shall also be observed in all the Ports of <hi>France,</hi> as to the People and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the said Commonwealth. And that the People, Subjects and Inhabitants of the one part, shall enjoy the like, and as ample Privileges and Immunities in the Kingdoms, Countries and Dominions of the other, both in Courts of Justice and Trade, as the People of any Foreign Nation in Amity with them do, or may enjoy there.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. For the further encrease of Commerce between the People and Subjects of either Nation, it is agreed, That the Merchants and other the People of the said Commonwealth, shall have free Liberty, and Right to make their last Wills and Testaments, and to dispose, as they please, either amongst the living, or in respect, or for cause of death, their merchandise, Silver, Moneys, Debts, and all their moveable Goods, which either they have, or ought to have, in their life, or at the time of their death, in any the Dominions and Places of the said King; And also whether they dye <hi>Testate,</hi> or <hi>Intestate,</hi> that the Heirs and Executors of them, as well inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated, as named in the Testaments, or otherwise by Law assured them, shall enjoy their Goods, according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> in what place soever of <hi>France</hi> they shall dy; in such sort as that the Right of <hi>Aubeyne,</hi> commonly called <hi>Droit d'Aubeyne,</hi> be no hinderance to them, or that their Goods be confiscated by vertue thereof. And that the Subjects of the <hi>French</hi> King shall have and enjoy the same liberty, freedom and privilege in all the Dominions of the said Commonwealth. Nevertheless it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be understood, that the Wills and Testaments or Successions of <hi>Intestates,</hi> as well of the People of the said Commonwealth, as of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the said King, shall be lawfully proved in the places where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent died, whether the same happen to be in <hi>France,</hi> or in the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. That the Inhabitants of the Islands of <hi>Jersey</hi> and <hi>Guernsey</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:172839:4"/> shall enjoy the same privileges and immunities in <hi>France,</hi> as the French en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in those Islands; paying on both sides the Tols &amp; customs which are due.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. That for the better preventing all depredations and wrongs for the future, It is agreed, That the Commanders and Owners of any arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ship or Ships, belonging to the Subjects of either, which shall go forth to Sea, out of the Ports or Havens of each other, shall before their going out, give good and sufficient Security by responsible Men, not of the Ships Company, before the Judges of the Admiralty, or other Magistrates of those places whence they go, in the double value of their Ships lading, tackle and other appurtenances, for their good behaviour at Sea, and that they will not take, seize upon, or otherwise molest, or do any injury to the People or Subjects of either, their Goods, Ships or Vessels. And in case the Judges of the Admiralty, and other Magistrates aforesaid, neglect to receive Security, or shall receive insufficient Security, they shall be bound to answer in their own names for the wrongs that shall be done.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Till a more certain and determinate course be taken for remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mischiefs and inconveniences which may arise at Sea, It is agreed, That for the space of four years, next immediatly ensuing the Ratification of this present Treaty, all Ships belonging to the People and Subjects of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and trafficking in the <hi>Mediterranean, East Sea,</hi> or <hi>Ocean,</hi> be free, and make their lading free, albeit they carry in them Merchandise, yea Grain or Pulse belonging to the Enemies of either, except notwithstanding all prohibited and contraband Commodities, <hi>viz.</hi> Gunpowder, Musquets, all sorts of Arms, Munition, Horses, and Provisions of War. And that they transport not Men for the service of the Enemies of either; In which case as well the Ships as the Provision and Merchandise aboard may be lawfull prize; which also shall be severely exercised against those, who shall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Men, Corn or Victuals into any the places besieged by either Part.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. That both Parties shall straitly charge the Admirals, Vice-Admirals, and other Captains of whatsoever Ships belonging to them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, or bearing their Flag, or going under their respective Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and in their service, That they do not seise upon, or take, or by any means molest or injure the Ships or Vessels of either, their Goods or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandises, or of the People and Subjects of either, but that they strictly observe and keep this Treaty and Agreement. And in case they shall do contrary hereunto, he or they so offending, shall be punished with corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall punishment, according to the nature of the offence, by that Party to whom he doth belong, and shall likewise make satisfaction for the wrong
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172839:5"/> he hath done, if he be able; or if not able, that Confederate to whom he belongs, shall be bound to make satisfaction and reparation to the Parties wronged, within Three Moneths after notice given to him, and Demand made of the Wrong and Injury done: And that the Ships of War meeting with the Merchants Ships of either side, shall, whiles they steer the same course, defend them against all such as shall forcibly attempt them.</p>
